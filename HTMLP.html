    <p>Overview</p>
    <div class="a">
        The Google Pixel 6 Pro is Google's latest flagship to compete with the likes of Apple's Iphone 13 Pro/Pro Max and Samsung S22 Ultra. Google surprise us with announcing its price of $899 which is a $100 cheaper than the 13 Pro and a few hundreds less than
        the S22 Ultra. I am exhilarated to try it out as Google have a track record in having phones with flagship price but comprimsing hardware. The Pixel 6 Pro is truely a flagship contender thanks to the hardware, camera and features that we are going
        to talk about. If you decide to buy it or just want to take a look, you can click the link <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_6_pro?hl=en-GB">here</a>.

    <p>Display</p>
    <div class="b">
        The Pixel 6 Pro has a 1440x3120 19.5:9 LTPO AMOLED 120hz Display with corning gorilla victus. This is the best display Google has come out with and I love it. The color gamut is accurate, watching videos is colourful and enjoyable, However, I wish it
        could be brighter as the peak brightness is around a thousand nits. Samsung S22 Ultra can reach a mind boggling 1700 nits which is insane but the price difference indicates that the display that is used on the Pixel is cheaper than the S22 Ultra.
        The 120hz is butterly smooth and thanks to the LTPO technology it can adaptively tune down to 10hz when there are no inputs to save battery.

    <p>Performance</p>
    <div class="c">
        Google for the first time is using their in-house Tensor SOC which is built from a 5nm process manufactured by Samsung. The Tensor chip has built-in M2 Titan security chip for protect the Pixel 6 Pro from malware. One biggest feature is not the performance
        but the AI for voice dictation and any Google Assistant related features. Based on benchmarks, the Tensor chip lacks behind the competition by a bit but in real world use case, it is butterly smooth and feels better than Samsung S22 Ultra due
        to the use of stock Android. Having 12GB of RAM is more than enough for my use case but for performance users, you would have no problem opening up apps and having them in the backgroud. The use of Google software and hardware helps make the phone
        optimised. However, its still a long way to go until they catch up with Apple level of optimisation.
